# plotter-misc-debugging
Sandbox to make simple sketches to explore things in vsk.

As I use [vsketch](https://github.com/abey79/vsketch) in complicated plots and projects, sometimes I want to explore how a function works outside the scope of that larger project. This is a repo for me to play. Also if I think I found a bug or a suprising behavior I will probably explore it here to convince myself that I'm right about the behavior before reporting it.
